This Java repository implements a piggy bank system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it an excellent resource for learning and practicing key concepts. The code is structured with inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, providing a solid foundation for OOP development.

## Features
Implements a piggy bank system with different types of coins and bills.
Uses inheritance and polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible design.
Provides abstraction to separate the implementation details from the user interface.
Offers a CLI (Command-Line Interface) to interact with the system.
